# Prayer-Notifier
A modern Windows app that fetches real-time Islamic prayer times and reminds you before each prayer with notifications, countdowns, and customizable adhan audio. The program features a clean dark GUI, system-tray support, progress indicators, and background updating. Packaged as an EXE so it runs without installing Python.
